Cinema Booking System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the internet and can be accessed by anyone who has an internet connection. This application will automate the reservation of tickets and enquiries about availability of the tickets for specific movies. This application includes email confirmation for the tickets with a distinct QR-Code which can be validated with a scanner. Currently, this kind of system/technology is widely used in airline, hotel, travelling and other similar businesses.
