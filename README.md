## Intro

Cinema Booking System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the internet and can be accessed by anyone who has an internet connection. This application will automate the reservation of tickets and enquiries about availability of the tickets for specific movies. This application includes email confirmation for the tickets with a distinct QR-Code which can be validated with a scanner. Currently, this kind of system/technology is widely used in airline, hotel, travelling and other similar businesses.

## Scope and mission

Currently this software aims to replace phone based reservation of tickets and to shrink the time spent in queues during face-to-face reservation. Also this software is going to solve the following problems:

* Prank call - The most common problem that occurs at cinemas with phone based booking is the prank call. Since, there are no gates for authenticating the user, anyone is able to make a reservation. In this situation, many people will take the advantage to make a prank call. They will make a lot of reservations without collecting the tickets.
* Phone line traffic jams - Customer will make a phone call to enquire the movie show-time and they will spend some time to choose the movie section. On the other hand, other customers will try to make phone call reservations as well. Therefore, phone line traffic jams will occur. Some customers will be unable to contact the operators.
